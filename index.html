It is antiquated, slow, prone to errors,									full of forgotten data entry, has minimal reporting abilities, zero audit trails, and is not									HIPAA compliant.								</p>								<p>FlexScanMD can be accessed by you online from anywhere in the world and provides instant,									real-time stats, reports, and alerts! Working across multiple locations is a breeze and									having									audit trails of who did what is priceless.								</p>								<p>Another way to look at this…								</p>								<p>Imagine if every time you went to the grocery store checkout that you had to manually enter									every single item you are purchasing into an Excel spreadsheet? That store would quickly go									out									of business.								</p>								<p>With FlexScanMD in your Practice, you will also be able to use scanners to quickly scan items									out of Inventory. Like a grocery store, this is quick, accurate and provides you with the									real-time data and metrics you need to run a highly successful Practice!								</p>							</div>						</div>						<div class="spoller-asked__item">							<div class="spoller-asked__title _spoller">What is the advantage of Cloud or SaaS inventory								management?							</div>							<div class="spoller-asked__body">								<p> Every successful and growing company across all industries uses									Cloud-based systems (also known as Saas – Software as a Service). Whether it is your email									provider, bookkeeping, Electronic Health Record or Practice Management system or simply your									Payroll service, most likely it is a Cloud-based (on the Internet) service.								</p>								<p> Having everything in the Cloud (internet) means you have instant redundancy with back up									measures, real-time access and you are always using the latest version of the system. Nothing									to									download, install, re-install, or worry about a complete loss of your hard work and data due									to									fire, theft or equipment failure.								</p>								<p> While Software as a Service (Saas) means you pay annual or monthly fees rather than a large									up-front expense, it also means that your Software is always running, you never need to ‘buy									the									latest version’, and customer support is always just a phone call or email away.								</p>								<p> Plus, you do not need to pay for an IT staff or have the ongoing expense of maintenance and									upkeep for in-house servers and devices.								</p>							</div>						</div>						<div class="spoller-asked__item">							<div class="spoller-asked__title _spoller">How can I keep track of expiring medicines?</div>							<div class="spoller-asked__body">								<p>									No worries, FlexScanMD will send email alerts to whomever you wish, and display these alerts									on the main screen. You will always know which items are expiring, within a time parameter of									your choosing, giving you plenty of time to use that stock so it doesn’t go to waste.</p>							</div>						</div>					</div>				</div>			</section>			<section class="info">				<div class="info__content _container">					<div class="info__title title">Need More Information?</div>					<div class="info__subtitle">Request a Personalized Demo for your medical specialty today!</div>					<a href="Request.html" class="info__button button">Request Demo</a>				</div>			</section>		</main>		<footer class="footer">	<div class="footer__content _container">		<div class="footer__top">			<a href="index.html" class="footer__logo"><picture><source srcset="img/footer/logo.webp" type="image/webp"><img src="img/footer/logo.png" alt=""></picture></a>			<ul class="footer__social">				<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/FlexScanMD" target="_blank" class="footer__social_link">						<picture><source srcset="img/footer/facebook.svg" type="image/webp"><img src="img/footer/facebook.svg" alt="facebook"></picture>					</a>				</li>				<li><a href="https://twitter.com/FlexScanMD" target="_blank" class="footer__social_link">						<picture><source srcset="img/footer/twitter.svg" type="image/webp"><img src="img/footer/twitter.svg" alt=""></picture>					</a>				</li>				<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/flexscanmd" target="_blank" class="footer__social_link">						<picture><source srcset="img/footer/linkedin.svg" type="image/webp"><img src="img/footer/linkedin.svg" alt=""></picture>					</a>				</li>			</ul>		</div>		<div class="footer__center">			<div class="footer__info">				<div class="footer__adress">4 Charles Colman Blvd. Suite 1					<span>Pawling, NY 12564</span>				</div>				<div class="footer__tel">Office: (800) 886-7605<span>(845) 204-8611</span></div>				<div class="footer__fax">Fax: (888) 280-2347</div>			</div>			<div class="footer__body">				<div class="footer__title">SITE LINKS</div>				<ul class="footer__list">					<li><a href="index.html" class="footer__link">Home</a></li>					<li><a href="Specialties.html" class="footer__link">Specialties</a></li>					<li><a href="Partners.html" class="footer__link">Partners</a></li>					<li><a href="Request.html" class="footer__link">Request Demo</a></li>					<li><a href="AboutUs.html" class="footer__link">About Us</a></li>				</ul>			</div>		</div>		<div class="footer__bottom">			<div class="footer__copy">© 2021 FlexScanMD Rights Reserved.</div>			<a href="Privacy.html" class="footer__privacy">Privacy Policy</a>		</div>	</div></footer>	</div>	<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.min.js"></script><script src="js/vendors.min.js"></script><script src="js/app.min.js"></script></body></html>
